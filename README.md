# Welcome to the Chrysalis Imaris Xtension Page


The [Chrysalis Imaris Xtensions](https://github.com/ChrysalisImaging/Chrysalis-Imaris-Xtensions) have been developed at the University of Minnesota by Dmitri Kotov (kotov003@umn.edu) in Marc Jenkins' laboratory in collaboration with Thomas Pengo of the University of Minnesota University Imaging Center. 

These Xtensions aid in quantitative, multispectral image analysis in Imaris for static images (4D Images), like those acquired on confocal or epifluorescent microscopes, as well as for 2-photon movies (5D images). Additionally, many of these Xtensions are intended for batch processing images. This batch functionality allows for the batching of histo-cytometry analysis, thereby greatly speeding up the histo-cytometry workflow.

## Acknowledgments

The XTChrysalis Xtension utilizes data generated by a customized version of the Sortomato Xtension, which was originally written by Peter Beemiller and modified by Dmitri Kotov and Thomas Pengo.

Matthew J. Gastinger, Ph.D contributed to the Chrysalis Imaris Xtensions, with portions of the XTChrysalis and XTChrysalis2phtn scripts utilizing code from his Kiss and Run Imaris Xtension. Other Xtensions in the Chrysalis-Imaris-Xtensions folder, like XTCreateSurfaces, are dervide from the XTChrysalis and XTChrysalis2phtn Xtensions and may therefore also contain code generated by Dr. Gastinger.
