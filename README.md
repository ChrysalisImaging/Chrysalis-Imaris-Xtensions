# Welcome to the Chrysalis Imaris Xtension Page


The Chrysalis Imaris Xtensions have been developed at the University of Minnesota by Dmitri Kotov (kotov003@umn.edu) in Marc Jenkins' laboratory in collaboration with Thomas Pengo of the University of Minnesota University Imaging Center. 

XTChrysalis analyzes static images (4D images), like those acquired on confocal or epifluorescent microscopes, while XTChrysalis2phtn analyzes 2-photon movies (5D images).
